# # Toggle

# ## Basic
# Set `mode='toggle'` to show a toggle.
#
# A toggle represents a physical switch that allows someone to choose between two mutually exclusive options.
# For example, “On/Off”, “Show/Hide”. Choosing an option should produce an immediate result.
#
# Note that unlike a checkbox, a toggle returns its value immediately, much like a button.
# This lets you handle the changed value immediately.
# To keep the toggle displayed until the user is done, call `view()` inside a `while` loop.
