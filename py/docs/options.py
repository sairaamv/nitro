# # Options

# ## Basic
# An `option` represents one of several choices to be presented to the user.
# It's used by all kinds of pickers: buttons, dropdowns, checklists, color pickers, and so on.
#
# An option has a `value` and `text`, created using `option(value, text)`.
#
# - The `value` is the value returned when the user picks that option. It is not user-visible.
# - The `text` is typically used as a label for the option.
#
# If `text` is not provided, then the `value` is also used as the `text`.
#
# There are other, more concise ways to specify options, explained in later examples.

        option('orange', 'Orange'),
        option('red', 'Red'),
    ]))
    view(f'You chose {choice}.')


# ## From sequence
# If `options` is a sequence (tuple, set or list), the elements of the sequence are used as options.
def options_sequence(view: View):
    choice = view(box('Choose a color', options=[
        'green', 'yellow', 'orange', 'red'

# ## From string
# If `options=` is set to a string, each word in the string is used as an option.

    view(f'You chose {choice}.')


# In other words, `'green yellow orange red'` is shorthand for `['green', 'yellow', 'orange', 'red']`.

# ## From tuples
# `options=` can also be specified as a sequence of `(value, text)` tuples.

# ## From dictionary
# `options=` can also be specified as a `dict` of `value: text` entries.

# This is the most concise way to pass options where labels differ from values.

# ## Selected
# Set `selected=True` to pre-select an option.

# Another way to pre-select an option is to set `value=` on the box, as shown in the next example.
