# Toggle



## Basic

Set `mode='toggle'` to show a toggle.

A toggle represents a physical switch that allows someone to choose between two mutually exclusive options.
For example, “On/Off”, “Show/Hide”. Choosing an option should produce an immediate result.

Note that unlike a checkbox, a toggle returns its value immediately, much like a button.
This lets you handle the changed value immediately.
To keep the toggle displayed until the user is done, call `view()` inside a `while` loop.


```py
glazed, sprinkles, hot, done = True, False, False, False
while not done:
    glazed, sprinkles, hot, done = view(
        '### Customize my donut!',
        box('Make it glazed', mode='toggle', value=glazed),
        box('Add sprinkles', mode='toggle', value=sprinkles),
        box('Make it hot', mode='toggle', value=hot),
        box(['Place order'])
    )
view(f'''
You want your donut {"glazed" if glazed else "frosted"}, 
{"with" if sprinkles else "without"} sprinkles, 
and {"hot" if hot else "warm"}!
''')
```
